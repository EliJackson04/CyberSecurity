spotted lagoon jellyfish are found in the atlantic ocean, they live in lagoons because of the shallow warm water. they feed off of photosynthesis, freshly hatched baby brine shrimp and coral reef algae. their bell grows up to 20 cm (8 inches) and are the most popular jellyfish to be used in aqauriums because of how low maintenance they are. they also feed off of their zooxanthellae, zooxanthellae is a dinoflagellate found in their cytoplasm that uses the sun for photosynthesis.
